# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Terminal User Interface (TUI) application written in Go that displays real-time system resource usage information. The application will provide users with an interactive, console-based interface to monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, disk usage, and network activity in a visually appealing format similar to tools like htop or btop.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view real-time CPU usage statistics, so that I can monitor system performance and identify potential bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display current CPU usage percentage
2. WHEN CPU usage changes THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time with refresh intervals of 1 second or less
3. WHEN multiple CPU cores are present THEN the system SHALL display individual core usage percentages
4. WHEN displaying CPU usage THEN the system SHALL show both current usage and a historical graph or bar representation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor memory usage including RAM and swap, so that I can optimize my applications and prevent out-of-memory issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application displays memory information THEN the system SHALL show total, used, and available RAM in human-readable format (GB/MB)
2. WHEN swap memory is configured THEN the system SHALL display swap usage statistics
3. WHEN memory usage changes THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time
4. WHEN displaying memory usage THEN the system SHALL show usage as both absolute values and percentages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view disk usage information for all mounted filesystems, so that I can manage storage space effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display disk usage for all mounted filesystems
2. WHEN displaying disk information THEN the system SHALL show filesystem name, total space, used space, and available space
3. WHEN disk usage changes THEN the system SHALL update the display periodically
4. WHEN displaying disk usage THEN the system SHALL show usage percentages and warn when usage exceeds 90%

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to monitor network interface activity, so that I can track bandwidth usage and network performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application displays network information THEN the system SHALL show active network interfaces
2. WHEN network activity occurs THEN the system SHALL display bytes sent and received per interface
3. WHEN displaying network stats THEN the system SHALL show current transfer rates (KB/s, MB/s)
4. WHEN multiple network interfaces exist THEN the system SHALL display statistics for each interface separately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive keyboard-driven interface, so that I can navigate and interact with the monitoring application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses 'q' or 'Ctrl+C' THEN the system SHALL gracefully exit the application
2. WHEN the user presses arrow keys or tab THEN the system SHALL allow navigation between different resource sections
3. WHEN the user presses 'r' THEN the system SHALL allow manual refresh of all statistics
4. WHEN the user presses 'h' or '?' THEN the system SHALL display help information with available keyboard shortcuts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the TUI to be visually appealing and responsive, so that I can easily interpret system information at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL use colors to differentiate between different types of information
2. WHEN displaying usage percentages THEN the system SHALL use progress bars or visual indicators
3. WHEN the terminal is resized THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout accordingly
4. WHEN usage levels are critical (>90%) THEN the system SHALL highlight them with warning colors
5. WHEN the application updates THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth rendering without flickering

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that it remains stable even when system information is temporarily unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system information cannot be retrieved THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
2. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL continue displaying available information
3. WHEN the application encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue running
4. WHEN system resources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show "N/A" or similar placeholder text
